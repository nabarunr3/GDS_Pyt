four tasks at hand:

1. read the fasta file in a dictionary and count the number of sequence records
2. Lengths of the sequences in a file returned as a dictionary. 
3. Identify all the ORFs of each sequence present in the FASTA file. 
	Also identify the identifier containing the longest ORF.
	For a given Identifier what is the longest ORF contained in that sequence?
	The starting position of the longest ORF?
4. Given a length n, identify all repeats of length n in all the sequneces in the file. 
	Also how many times each repeat occurs in the file. 
	Which is the most frequent repeat of a given length.
